# small-web-projects

Some mini-projects to get my hands dirty with web techonologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A few of these are done in code-alongs or as solutions to assignments in [Udemy - The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele. The others are just random ideas to get some practice.
